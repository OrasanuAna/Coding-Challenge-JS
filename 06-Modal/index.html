      <h1>Beautiful Places</h1>
      <p>
        Our planet is adorned with so much breathtaking beauty, from ancient
        forests and historical ruins to stunning lakes, rivers, and seas. These
        places are so gorgeous that it can be tough to decide which of the most
        beautiful places in the world you want to visit next. Europe for
        example, offers the ease of train travel for visiting multiple marvels
        in one trip, while the deserts and cities of South America may be more
        challenging to navigate.
